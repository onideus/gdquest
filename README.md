# Godot 2D Course Progress Tracker

This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress through the [Learn 2D GameDev with Godot 4](https://school.gdquest.com/products/learn_2d_gamedev_godot_4) course by GDquest. Here, I'll be collecting notes, code samples, and experiments as I work through the course modules.
