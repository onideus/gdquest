# Module 7 - Lesson 4

I learned that:

- **Saving Resources for Reuse:** Once I’ve configured a resource—like a theme or custom style—I can save it as a separate `.tres` or `.res` file. Then I can drop it into any project or scene and maintain a consistent look without rebuilding from scratch.
- **Creating a Theme Resource:** A Theme in Godot is a container for style overrides. I can create a new Theme resource, add class-specific items (fonts, colors, styles), and then assign that Theme to any Control node to apply all my custom styling at once.
- **Changing the Default Font Size:** Inside my Theme resource, there’s a “Default Font” entry where I can set the global font and tweak its size. This immediately updates every Control that uses the default font, keeping typography uniform across my UI.
- **Styling RichTextLabel:** By overriding the Theme’s “RichTextLabel” properties, I can adjust the text color, background color, and other style parameters—so my formatted text pops exactly how I want it.
- **Customizing Button States:** Buttons in Godot have multiple states (normal, hover, pressed, disabled). In my Theme, I can supply different background textures or border settings for each state, giving my buttons interactive feedback and a polished feel.
