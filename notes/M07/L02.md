# Module 7 - Lesson 2

I discovered that:

- **Hands-On Experimentation:** Diving in and trying things myself is the best way to really grasp new concepts—tutorials only take you so far.
- **Using Containers:** Containers offer a structured way to layout multiple controls without manually positioning each one.
- **Anchor Presets:** Godot’s anchor presets let me snap UI elements into common layouts instantly.
- **Manual Anchor Adjustment:** For pixel-perfect control, I can drag each anchor to fine-tune how a node scales and moves with the window.
- **Anchor Behavior:** Anchors determine a Control node’s size and position relative to its parent or the viewport, making them fundamental for responsive interfaces.
