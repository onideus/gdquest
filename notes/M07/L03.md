# Module 7 - Lesson 3

I learned that:

- **Relative Positioning:** A Control node’s position and size are always calculated relative to its parent Control node or, if there isn’t one, the viewport.
- **Anchor-Driven Layout:** Unless a Control is placed inside a container (coming up in the next module), its anchors determine exactly where and how large it appears.
- **Control Types & Their Uses:**  
  - A plain **Control** node acts as a flexible container for other UI elements.  
  - **ColorRect** draws a simple, flat-colored rectangle—perfect for backgrounds.  
  - **TextureRect** displays images that can be resized, anchored, and kept in aspect ratio.  
  - **RichTextLabel** handles formatted or multi-style text.  
  - **Button** provides built-in interactivity for clicks and hovers.  
- **Practical Anchoring:** By tweaking anchor presets or dragging anchor handles manually, I can make UI elements that adapt perfectly to different window sizes.
