## Module 6 - Lesson 1

I'm really excited about the next workbook—Module 6! In this lesson, we're diving into some cool new features that will level up my game development skills:

- **Input Handling:** I learned how to recognize mouse input and hover motions, which are also perfect for touch screen controls.
- **Property Exporting:** I'm now getting to grips with managing the export ability for properties. This makes tweaking values in the Inspector much easier.
- **Shaders:** We're also starting to explore shaders, which are key for adding those extra visual touches to refine my games.

What really grabbed my attention is the workbook's opening scene—a castle dungeon. Although I won't be building environments like that just yet, the notes assure me that later on in the course, I'll learn how to create sprite maps, tilesets, and palettes to build epic environments just like this and even more!

I can't wait to see how these new skills will come together to make my projects even more engaging.
