# Module 6 - Lesson 9

This particular lesson was more of a guided practice exam, and as such had three increasingly difficult mechanics to add to the dungeon without assistance.
Throughout this lesson I was able to:

- **Collecting Items:** I created functions to allow for the collection of items with animations. Items check to determine which is on top and only collect that item.
- **Toggling Flames:** The torches are using a flame material that required creating a new 2D body to interact with appropriatly, changing the torch object type to gain
access to more explicity event handling.
- **Hopping Birds:** Starting from the animation functionality provided by the items that come out of an opened chest, I handled the shadow independent of the sparrow
to give the illusion of three dimensional movement on a two dimensional canvas.
