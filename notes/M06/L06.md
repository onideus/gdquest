# Module 6 - Lesson 6

I learned that:

- **Exporting Variables:** By annotating with `@export`, I can expose script properties directly in the Inspector for easy tweaking without touching code.
- **Polar Coordinates:** Using polar math (angle and radius), I can position items evenly around a circle centered on any point.
- **Random Loop Counts:** The combination of `randi_range()` (for random integers) and `range()` lets me run loops a random number of timesâ€”perfect for varied, unpredictable behavior.
- **Function Chaining:** Since functions that return values can be nested or chained, I can streamline code by plugging one call directly into another when their inputs and outputs match.
