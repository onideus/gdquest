## Module 6 - Lesson 3

This was another long lesson! Here's an overview of the key concepts I learned:

- **Using @onready Variables:** I discovered that storing references to nodes in `@onready` variables is a huge win for code clarity. This approach not only simplifies node access but also provides better autocompletion and type checking in my IDE. By initializing these variables when the node is ready, I can be sure that all references are properly set before I use them in my scripts.

- **Resource Sharing and Uniqueness:** I learned that resources in Godot are shared by default. If I need a resource to be unique for each instance of a scene, I can set its `local_to_scene` property to `true`. This is essential for avoiding unintended side effects when multiple nodes use the same resource.

- **Shader Material Properties:** I now know how to dynamically change the properties of a shader material using the `set_shader_parameter()` function. This lets me tweak visual effects on the fly, making my projects even more interactive and visually appealing.

- **Dollar Sign Shortcut:** The lesson showed me a neat trick: using the dollar sign (`$`) as a shortcut to the `get_node()` function. This shorthand not only reduces code clutter but also speeds up my workflow when accessing nodes.

- **Tween Method Animation:** I explored the `tween_method()` function, which allows me to animate anything via code—even if it isn’t directly a node property. This opens up a whole new range of possibilities for creating dynamic animations.

- **Mouse Entered/Exited Signals:** Finally, I learned that the `mouse_entered` and `mouse_exited` signals are automatically emitted when the mouse moves over or leaves an area. This is perfect for creating responsive, interactive elements in my game.
