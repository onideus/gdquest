# Lesson Recap: Chest Outline

Here's a quick rundown of what I've learned in this lesson:

- **CanvasGroup Node:** I took a deep dive into CanvasGroup nodes in Godot. These nodes let me flatten all of their children into a single image, making it super easy to apply uniform visual effects across multiple elements. Whether it's for global color adjustments, transparency tweaks, or applying shaders, CanvasGroup nodes are a real time-saver—especially when working with complex UIs.

- **Shaders and Materials:** I learned how shaders and materials work hand-in-hand to add custom visual effects to nodes. Shaders let me control how nodes are rendered, and materials supply the parameters to fine-tune those effects.

- **Opacity Adjustment:** I discovered that tweaking a node's **Self Modulate** property in the Inspector allows me to adjust its opacity effortlessly. This is great for creating dynamic visuals and smooth transitions.

- **Scene Dock Order:** I found out that the order of nodes in the Scene dock is crucial. Nodes positioned higher in the list get drawn first, while those lower down appear on top—an essential concept for managing visual layering.

- **Multiple Node Creation:** I also learned that dragging and dropping multiple files from the file system into the viewport creates several nodes at once, which really speeds up my workflow.
