# Module 6 - Lesson 5

I learned that:

- **Detecting Clicks on Area2D:** I can use the `_input_event()` function on an `Area2D` (like my chest) to catch all input events that occur within its collision shape.

- **Type Checking with `is`:** Inside `_input_event()`, I can use the `is` keyword to verify the exact type of event (for example, checking if it’s a `InputEventMouseButton`).

- **Combining Conditions:** By using the `and` keyword, I can merge multiple boolean checks into one expression—handy for “if it’s a left-click **and** a release” scenarios.

- **Readable Expressions:** If my condition gets long, I can assign it to a variable first. That way, my `if` statements stay clean and easy to understand.

- **Playing Animations in Code:** I discovered that the `AnimationPlayer` node’s `play()` method lets me trigger animations directly from a script.

- **Disabling Input Picks:** When I don’t want a node to respond to clicks or hovers anymore, I simply set its `input_pickable` property to `false`.

- **Leveraging Existing State:** Instead of inventing new global variables, I can often repurpose existing node properties or built-in engine flags to track whether an action has already occurred.
