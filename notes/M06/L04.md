## Module 6 - Lesson 4

ere's a quick review of what I learned about animations in Godot:

- **AnimationPlayer Node:** I discovered that the AnimationPlayer node is my go-to tool for creating and managing animations manually.
- **Animating Any Property:** I learned that I can animate virtually any property on any node within my scene, giving me immense flexibility.
- **Creating Keyframes:** By clicking the key icon next to any property in the Inspector, I can easily create animation tracks and keyframes.
- **Animation Tracks & Keyframes:** I now understand that animations are constructed from tracks that store these keyframes, each representing a specific value at a given moment.
- **Smooth Interpolation:** Godot automatically interpolates the values between keyframes, ensuring that my animations are smooth and fluid.
