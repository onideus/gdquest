# Module 6 - Lesson 8

I learned that:

- **Built-In Documentation:** Godot’s Code Reference is a comprehensive, built-in help system listing every class, method, property, and signal the engine provides.
- **Quick Search Access:** I can open the Code Reference search by navigating to **Help → Search Help**, pressing **F1** (or **⌥ Space** on Mac), and instantly start looking up API entries.
- **On-Demand Lookup & Discovery:** Whether I need details on a specific function in my script or want to browse for features I haven’t used yet, the Code Reference is my go-to resource for in-editor documentation.
