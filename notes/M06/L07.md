# Module 6 - Lesson 7

I learned that:

- **Creating Independent Tweens:** I can call `create_tween()` multiple times to spin up distinct tween objects, each with its own timing and settings.
- **Layering Animations:** By running tweens in parallel, I can overlap and combine animations to craft more complex procedural effects.
- **Custom Easing:** Using `set_ease()`, I can control how an animation accelerates or decelerates over time, giving my movements extra polish.
