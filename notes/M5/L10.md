# My Lesson Recap

Today, I learned some really cool techniques that are going to level up my game development skills. Here's what I discovered:

- **Tween Animations:** I found out how to create tweens that animate properties over time in my code. This means I can bring my projects to life with smooth, dynamic movements.
- **Looping Tweens:** I learned that using the `set_loops()` function lets me loop these animations, which is perfect for creating repeating effects.
- **Transition Functions:** I explored how to use transition functions to switch up the tween's transition type, giving me more control over the animation flow.
- **Randomization:** I also discovered how to randomize animations using the `randf_range()` function along with random numbers, which adds a fun element of unpredictability to my work.

Wrapping up this long module, I can honestly say I did a great job. While I didn’t create a complete game—since there’s no win or lose condition—the demo I built feels a lot more like a game than just a toy, and that’s a huge step forward.

This project was all about teaching me the basics of game development. I got hands-on experience with composition, refactoring, user interface design, managing areas, collision layers and masks, creating instances at runtime, working with random numbers, and of course, tween animations. These are the building blocks I’ll be using again and again in my future projects and throughout this course.

I’m excited to keep pushing forward and applying everything I learned today. Happy coding!
